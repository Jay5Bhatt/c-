                In computer technology, the console is simply a combination of a monitor and an input device. Generally, the input device is referred to here as the pair of mouse and keyboard. In order to proceed with the topic, we have to understand the terminology of computer science, which is an important part of the process of developing software, and itâ€™s called debugging. Debugging is the process of identifying a bug or an error and fixing it properly for the software. We have to test the software before producing it on market in multiple phases. We have to debug the errors also, then only software will be pure error-free and it will be ready for production. The most of the things which computer does with our code is invisible for us. For Debugging, we have to identify the error first then only we can solve that error. If you want to see the error, then you have to print or log it to our console directly. There are many and different methods in different programming languages for doing it.
